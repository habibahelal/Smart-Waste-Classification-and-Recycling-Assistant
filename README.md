# Smart Waste Classification and Recycling Assistant

This project implements a **Smart Waste Classification and Recycling Assistant** using **deep learning and computer vision** techniques. It explores multiple approaches‚Äîranging from **data preprocessing and augmentation** to **CNNs, transfer learning, object detection (YOLO), GAN-based augmentation, and autoencoders**‚Äîto build a robust waste classification system that supports **sustainability and recycling initiatives**.

## üìå Project Description

Improper waste sorting is a global environmental challenge. Manual sorting is often **inefficient, error-prone, and labor-intensive**. This project leverages **AI-powered computer vision models** to automatically detect, classify, and denoise waste images, forming the foundation for **smart bins, recycling plants, and municipal services**.

The work is based on the **TrashNet dataset**, which contains images of six waste categories:

* **Cardboard**
* **Glass**
* **Metal**
* **Paper**
* **Plastic**
* **Trash**

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**

   * Cleaning, resizing, normalization.
   * Classical augmentation (rotation, flips, brightness, contrast, cropping).

2. **CNNs & Transfer Learning**

   * Baseline CNN model as a starting point.
   * Transfer learning with **ResNet50, EfficientNetB1, MobileNetV3Small**.
   * Achieved best accuracy with **EfficientNetB1 (\~88% validation, \~85% test)**.

3. **YOLOv8 Object Detection**

   * Real-time waste localization with bounding boxes.
   * Precision: **0.919**, Recall: **0.926**, mAP: **>97%**.
   * Strongest results for **paper, cardboard, glass**.

4. **GANs for Data Augmentation**

   * Generated synthetic images for minority classes.
   * Faced challenges with instability and noisy outputs.
   * Highlighted trade-offs between **quality and diversity**.

5. **Autoencoder for Image Denoising**

   * Encoder‚ÄìDecoder architecture for removing Gaussian noise.
   * Achieved **PSNR = 30.60 dB** and **SSIM = 0.8769**, producing cleaner reconstructions.

## üìä Results Overview

* **Custom CNN:** 58% validation accuracy ‚Üí limited baseline.
* **ResNet50 & VGG16:** Solid improvements, up to \~85%.
* **EfficientNetB1:** Best overall accuracy and efficiency.
* **MobileNetV3Small:** Good trade-off for mobile deployment.
* **YOLOv8:** High detection accuracy and real-time inference.
* **GANs:** Generated realistic but unstable synthetic samples.
* **Autoencoder:** Effective denoising with strong reconstruction metrics.
